We are pleased to announce that Puffin Security has been accepted to participate in Plexicus Cyber Security Marketplace

As one of the very first companies accepted, we are thrilled to be registered in the platform and soon to be able to quote for cyber security services. 

This is one of another multiple ways in which we are building the future, as traditional methods to hire cyber security experts are ever changing. 

At Puffin Security, we enjoy contributing knowledge regarding security projects to complex organizations as our team is composed by Certified Security Engineers who follow codes of conduct (The ISACA, (ISC)2 and ISSA codes of conduct – likewise the OSSTMM “Rules of Engagement”). For more information, feel free to [check our plexicus page](https://www.plexicus.com) or [request a quote](https://hub.puffinsecurity.com/quote)
